#Pokedex App

Hi! Are you ready for a fantastic adventure?
This world is full of creatures called Pokémon. They are friendly playmates and cooperative
workmates. But despite our closeness, we don’t know everything about them.
Our desire is to have a catalogue containing all data about Pokémon. Your job is to deliver it!
Task description:
Using [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co) create an interactive catalogue of Pokémon. Data
should be displayed on the screen in the form of a list, you should be able to load more data
as you wish and interact with existing elements. Your solution should be sent to us as a link
to Github.

####UI Preview:

- List with initial 20 Pokémons, containing basic information like: `name`, `type` and
  `sprite`.
- Button to load more pokémons onto a screen.
- After clicking the pokémon from the list, you should see on screen extra details about
  its: `weight` and `height`.
- UI doesn’t have to be perfect, just nice and minimalistic.
- 
####Core technology stack:

- React

####Good to have:

- Typescript
- Redux or other state management tools.
- UX enriching elements: loaders, transitions etc.
- Extra filters section, allowing to filter Pokémon by `name` and `type`.
- Dark and light theme.

####Example work preview:

- Read Pokémon API documentation
- Configure environment and dependencies
    - Prepare store data models
- Create UI
- Add required interactions to the UI
    - Add extra UX features: loaders, transitions
    - Add extra filters sectio

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
